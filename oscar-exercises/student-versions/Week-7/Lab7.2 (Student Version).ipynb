    "The most straightforward way to combat climate change is to reduce our carbon emissions; however, given our modern society's dependence on using large amounts of energy, this may be difficult to achieve without rapid adoption (and improvement) of renewable energy technologies. In the event that we are not able to reduce emissions (e.g. if countries do not hold to their Paris agreement commitments), what options do we have to prevent temperatures from rising to dangerous levels?\n",
    "\n",
    "One option is so-called \"solar-geoengineering.\"  There have been multiple proposals that fall under this umbrella, which essentially aims at reducing the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the Earth.  One proposal is to inject large quantities of sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere; since sulfate aerosols are scattering, they reflect some incoming solar radiation back to space (which is a cooling effect).  This cooling effect could be engineered exactly to offset the warming associated with the anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases.  \n",
